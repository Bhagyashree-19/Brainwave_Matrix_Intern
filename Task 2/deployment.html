        <h2>Types of Cloud Deployment</h2>

        <div class="deployment-item">
            <span class="term">Public Cloud:</span> Cloud services offered to multiple users over the internet by third-party providers. A Public Cloud is a cloud computing model where computing resources and services (such as servers, storage, and networking) are owned and operated by third-party cloud providers and are available to multiple users over the internet. 
            <br><strong>Examples:</strong> AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud.
        </div>

        <div class="deployment-item">
            <span class="term">Private Cloud:</span> A dedicated cloud infrastructure used by a single organization for better security and control. A Private Cloud is a cloud computing model where the cloud infrastructure is exclusively used by a single organization. Unlike public clouds, private clouds offer greater security, control, and customization, making them ideal for businesses with strict compliance and data protection requirements.
            <br><strong>Example:</strong> On-premise data centers.
        </div>

        <div class="deployment-item">
            <span class="term">Community Cloud:</span> A cloud environment shared between organizations with common goals or compliance needs. A Community Cloud is a cloud computing model where the cloud infrastructure is shared by multiple organizations that have similar needs, policies, or regulatory requirements. It provides a balance between the security of a private cloud and the cost-effectiveness of a public cloud by allowing multiple organizations to share the same cloud resources.
            <br><strong>Example:</strong> Government agencies sharing cloud infrastructure.
        </div>

        <div class="deployment-item">
            <span class="term">Hybrid Cloud:</span> A combination of public and private cloud solutions to balance scalability and security. A Hybrid Cloud is a cloud computing model that combines both public and private cloud environments, allowing organizations to leverage the benefits of both. It enables data and applications to move between private and public clouds based on needs, security, and cost considerations.
            <br><strong>Example:</strong> A company using both AWS (public) and a private data center.
